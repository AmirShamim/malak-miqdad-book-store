  <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">I am Malak. Our home in Gaza was destroyed by fire. We lost family members and have lived displaced—sometimes in a tent, sometimes moving again before we can rest. In this uncertainty I held onto two things: learning and the memory of food that made us feel human.</p>
  <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When my university was destroyed I turned fully to e‑learning. Connection is unstable, power is scarce, and illness, hunger, and fear are constant. But I still study—and I began writing recipes that adapt to extreme limits: little fuel, few spices, substitutions for missing staples.</p>
  <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">These books are not only recipes. They are proof that even in destruction we can build small bridges to the future. Each page preserves heritage and provides practical methods for nourishment when resources are low.</p>
