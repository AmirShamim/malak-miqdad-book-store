  <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">My name is <strong>Malak</strong>. I live in Gaza with my family. Our house was destroyed by fire and we lost beloved family members. For months we moved from place to place, often in a tent—carrying only what we could. We have lived through fear, hunger, poverty, illness, and constant uncertainty.</p>
  <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Despite this, I continue studying through e‑learning after my university was destroyed. To support my family and keep hope alive, I created two recipe books that preserve parts of our food heritage and show how we cook with limited ingredients and fuel.</p>
  <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">We are a family of 10. Each of us needs support to rebuild, seek safety, and continue education. Our goal is to raise funds to leave Gaza for Egypt, build a safe home, and start a new future—away from daily danger.</p>
